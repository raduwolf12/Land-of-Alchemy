This is a 2D game made in unity, it is inspired by games like Stardew valley, Graveyard keeper, etc.
At the moment, the game is just a prototype. There is a small combat and magic system. Besides this, there are also 3 types of mobi with specific behavior. The artstyle is not original, it was taken from community free sources.
